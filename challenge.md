# Challenge: Expression Evaluator

> *Proposed by Marian Veteanu*

<br>

Dear coding club friends!

Happy Friday evening - and welcome to a new coding challenge!  
This time we’ll try to build an "expression evaluator"!

<br>

## Coding challenge

Imagine yourself a young student enrolled in the "Programming Languages & Techniques" class of Dave Matuszek.  
One day, Dave comes and gave the class a typical assignment for the class: Build an Expression Evaluator.

And since Dave knows that students may need a little bit of help, he is actually providing the full algorithm description in the assignment.
We will not reproduce here the assignment – but rather invite you to read it in the original, **[here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit594-2002/Assignments/5-expressions.html).**

We only ask you to implement your code in JavaScript … rather than Java – as Dave originally intended!  
And since we’re just pretending that we are in Dave’s class – you can also skip the entire "Requirements" section… that’s for students taking the actual course.

## Why is this important?

Parsing and evaluating expressions is an important concept in Computer Science. 
It is used in many fields, including interpreter / compiler construction – where evaluating expressions is an essential technique.
